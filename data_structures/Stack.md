# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of
Last In First Out (LIFO).
This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.

## Basic Operations of Stack

There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of a stack
2. **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of a stack
3. **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty
4. **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full
5. **Peek**: Get the value of the top element without removing it

## Working of Stack Data Structure

The operations work as follows:

1. A pointer called `TOP` is used to keep track of the top element in the stack.
2. When initializing the stack, we set its value to `-1` so that we can check if
the stack is empty by comparing `TOP == -1`.
3. On pushing an element, we increase the value of `TOP` and place the new element
in the position pointed to by TOP.
4. On popping an element, we return the element pointed to by `TOP` and reduce its
value.
5. Before pushing, we check if the stack is already full
6. Before popping, we check if the stack is already empty

### Stack Time Complexity

For the array-based implementation of a stack,
the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e. `O(1)`.

### Applications of Stack Data Structure

Although stack is a simple data structure to implement, it is very powerful.
The most common uses of a stack are:

- **To reverse a word** - Put all the letters in a stack and pop them out.
Because of the LIFO order of stack, you will get the letters in reverse order.
- **In compilers** - Compilers use the stack to calculate the value of
expressions like 2 + 4 / 5 * (7 - 9) by converting the expression to
prefix or postfix form.
- **In browsers** - The back button in a browser saves all the URLs you have visited
previously in a stack. Each time you visit a new page, it is added on top of the
stack. When you press the back button, the current URL is removed from the stack,
and the previous URL is accessed.
