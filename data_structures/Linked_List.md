# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of
connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address
of the next node.
You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first
node a special name called `HEAD`. Also, the last node in the
linked list can be identified because its next portion points to `NULL`.

Linked lists can be of multiple types: **singly**, **doubly**,
and **circular linked list**.
